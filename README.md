# Project Overview

The Plant Growth Tracker is a  desktop application built with Python and PyQt6 that helps plant enthusiasts monitor and manage their plant care routines. This system solves the problem of forgetting watering schedules and losing track of plant growth progress by providing an intuitive interface to track planting dates, watering status, and growth observations. People can use this application to maintain detailed records of their plants' development while receiving daily watering reminders. The application features a  SQLite database for data and an  earth-toned user interface for pleasant user experience.
